# 0. Prologue
Dec. 6, 2025

I'd like to keep a good record of what I work on, my documentation, my thoughts, etc.
so that I can read this later as well as improve my engineering note taking.

As such I'll be writing text into this docs directory.

## Structure

Docs have an index that numbers them from 0 onwards. They have a title separated by hyphens.
All docs must have their name formatted like so: `<index>-title.md`.

Internally all documents start with the index and title and then the date.
