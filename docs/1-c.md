# 1. C
Dec. 6, 2025.

I am not particularly good at C. I'm half-decent with C++ but I wouldn't say I have a particularly strong grasp of either language. My primary language was Java but now I honestly have no idea.

For the purpose of writing code that isn't completely garbage (and the secondary purpose of improving my skills) I'll be reading Modern C Ed. 3 by Jens Gustedt. I don't know if I'll get through all of it but it's pretty good so far.
